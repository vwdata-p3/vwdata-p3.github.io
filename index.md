**PEP3** is a experimental cryptographic system
to provide polymorphic encryption 
and pseudonymisation for large volumes of sensitive data. 
The system, which
is based on
[PEP](https://pep.cs.ru.nl),
has been designed
as part of the P3 project
of the 
[VWData program](https://commit2data.nl/vwdata)
to more securely store the flow records 
collected by network operators,
and help minimize the processing of personal data
in this context.

Details about PEP3 can be found [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02674),
and the system can be seen in action
[here](/links/demo).
